##Description

This is a class implementation of the wp.tuts+ tutorial: [Add jQuery Autocomplete to Your Siteâ€™s Search](http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/theme-development/add-jquery-autocomplete-to-your-sites-search/)

In the tutorial the javascript is inside a seperate file. For convenience for me- and because I feel the script is small enough - in this class I am printing the script in the footer (after the necessary jQuery files). Generally you should follow the method outlined in the tutorial.

This can be used as-is inside a functions.php or a plug-in. Whichever you feel is more appropriate for your use case.

### The class properties are
 
  - action: The name to identify the ajax action corresponding to generating a suggestion list. Should be unique to you and the action.
